This is the official repository of paper "Peer-Label Assisted Hierarchical Text Classification" in ACL'23. 
For purpose of illustration, we additionally provide some of the intermediate data from our experiments on BlurbGenreCollection(BGC). 
However, we apologize for not being able to provide the raw data since they are too large. 
Please refer to https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/resources/data/blurb-genre-collection.html for an easy access to the raw data. 
Thank you!
